    <img src="../images/tiramisu.jpg" alt="tiramisu" style="width:300px;height:500px;">

    <p>Tiramisu, meaning "pick-me-up" in Italian, is a classic dessert that lives up to its name. Layers of delicate
        ladyfingers soaked in coffee and liqueur mingle with a luscious mascarpone cream, creating a symphony of
        textures and
        flavors. It's rich yet light, creamy yet refreshing, and guaranteed to leave you wanting more.</p>

    <p>Here's how to whip up this Italian masterpiece in your own kitchen:</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>16 ounces mascarpone cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream, cold</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups strong brewed coffee, at room temperature</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons coffee liqueur (optional, like Kahlua or Tia Maria)</li>
        <li>40 ladyfingers (Savoiardi)</li>
        <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder, for dusting</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the cream:</strong>
            In a large bowl, whisk together the mascarpone cheese and sugar until smooth. In a separate
            bowl, whisk
            together the egg yolks and vanilla extract until pale and thick. Gradually whisk the egg yolks into the
            mascarpone
            mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Whip the heavy cream:</strong>
            In a clean bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the
            mascarpone mixture
            until just combined. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the tiramisu:</strong>
            In a shallow dish, mix the coffee with the liqueur (if using). Quickly dip each
            ladyfinger in the coffee mixture, coating both sides lightly but not letting it soak.</li>
        <li><strong>Arrange the ladyfingers:</strong>
            Arrange the dipped ladyfingers in a single layer in a baking dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Layering:</strong>
            Spread half of the mascarpone cream over the ladyfingers. Top with another layer of dipped ladyfingers.
            Spread the remaining cream over the second layer.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill:</strong>
            Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or ideally overnight, to allow the
            flavors to meld and the tiramisu to set.</li>
        <li><strong>Dust with Cocoa:</strong>
            Before serving, dust generously with unsweetened cocoa powder. Sift it through a fine-mesh strainer for an
            even dusting.</li>
    </ol>
