    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves, for garnish</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Crushed red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong>
        Preheat your oven according to the instructions on the pizza dough package or to 475°F (245°C).</li>
        
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong>
        Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. If you're using store-bought dough, follow the
        package instructions.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Assemble the Pizza:</strong>
        Place the rolled-out dough on a pizza stone or baking sheet. Brush the surface with olive oil to prevent sogginess.
        Spread an even layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Add Cheese and Toppings:</strong>
        Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce. Distribute the sliced mushrooms and halved cherry
        tomatoes on top. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Bake in the Oven:</strong>
        Transfer the pizza to the preheated oven and bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese
        is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Garnish:</strong>
        Once out of the oven, garnish your pizza with fresh basil leaves. If you like a bit of heat, sprinkle some crushed red
        pepper flakes over the top.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Slice and Serve:</strong>
        Allow the pizza to cool for a few minutes before slicing. Serve your Mushroom and Cherry Tomato Pizza hot and enjoy!</li>
