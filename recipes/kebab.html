    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef or lamb</li>
        <li>1 large onion, grated
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground sumac</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Olive oil (for brushing)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Meat Mixture:</strong>
            In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground meat, grated onion, egg, sumac, turmeric, cumin, salt, and
            pepper. Mix the ingredients thoroughly until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Marinate the Mixture (Optional):</strong>
            For enhanced flavor, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the mixture
            marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1-2 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Kebabs:</strong>
            Preheat your grill or oven to medium-high heat. Take a handful of the meat mixture and shape it around metal
            skewers, forming elongated kebabs. Ensure the meat is evenly distributed on the skewers.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooking:</strong>
            Grill the kebabs on the preheated grill or in the oven for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally. The
            kebabs should be cooked through and have a nicely charred exterior.</li>
        <li><strong>Brush with Olive Oil:</strong>
            While grilling, brush the kebabs with olive oil to keep them moist and add a delicious flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
            Once the Koobideh Kebabs are cooked to perfection, remove them from the grill or oven. Serve the kebabs on a
            plate, and you can optionally garnish with fresh herbs or a squeeze of lemon.</li>
